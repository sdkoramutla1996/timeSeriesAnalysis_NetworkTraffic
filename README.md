Network Traffic Time Series Analysis
This repository contains code and visualizations for a time series analysis project focused on network traffic prediction.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict future network traffic volume based on historical data. This model can be used for various purposes, such as:

  Capacity planning: Accurately predicting traffic volume helps network administrators allocate resources efficiently and anticipate potential bottlenecks.
  Security monitoring: Identifying unusual traffic patterns can aid in detecting suspicious activity or potential denial-of-service attacks.
  Traffic optimization: Understanding traffic patterns allows for implementing strategies to optimize network performance.

Data and Preprocessing
The data used for this project is network traffic captured over a period of 20 days. 

The data preprocessing steps involve:

  Feature extraction: Selecting relevant features from the raw data, such as bytes transferred, packets sent/received, and timestamps.
  Data segmentation: Dividing the data into smaller time intervals (e.g., 5 minutes) to create samples for model training.
  Data cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers in the data. (Optional: Specify methods used for cleaning)
  Smoothing: Applying techniques like Gaussian filter (refer to separate documentation for details) to reduce noise in the data.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project. Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements to the code, documentation, or visualizations.
